# Claustrophobic Highway :car:

You're on a highway with lots of cars around you. You need to avoid cars around you while trying to travel the furthest distance possible.
You need to keep moving (to reach the checkpoints) or you will run out of time and lose :oncoming_automobile:	.

Made By:
* Michael Nasr, Raiden (Programming)
* Toshi (3D Modelling & Music)

The best part of the project was creating the spawner algorithm that was in charge of increasing the density of the roads over time :man_technologist:.

This game was made in 2 days for the BenBonk #2 gameDev competition where we scored 15th place overall and got featured on his youtube video!
